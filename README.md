Yourls Dynamic Linker
=====================

A plugin for YOURLS allowing dynamic short url generation by having a base short url and adding a dash to it with whatever text you want.

Example:
=====================
If the user has a short url of /s going to google.com
and he typed into an email http://hiswebsite.com/s-header it would create that link and redirect to google.com,
without ever having to create a new url in the yourls dashboard
